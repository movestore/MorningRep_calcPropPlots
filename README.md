# Morning Report pdf Property Plots
MoveApps

Github repository: *github.com/movestore/MorningRep_calcPropPlots*

## Description
This App creates a multipage pdf downloadable file with time-plots of calculated data attributes for each individual track: net square displacement, daily number of positions, daily travelled distance and average daily distance to a given position. So, you get additional information about your animals and tag performance. 

## Documentation
A multipage pdf is created of 4 calculated data properties across time: net square displacement (in km, calculated by Vincenty Ellipsoid method), daily number of positions ("N Positions"), daily travelled distance in km (sum of successive pairwise Vincenty Ellipsoid distances; "Displacement (km)") and average daily distance to a given position in km ("Dist. to Posi. (km)"). The plotted time window is defined by the reference timestamp (either user-defined or by default NOW) and the time duration that defines how long before the reference timestamp the x-axis of the plots shall start.

### Input data
moveStack in Movebank format

### Output data
moveStack in Movebank format

### Artefacts
`MorningReport_NSDdailyProp.pdf`: Artefact pdf with a multiple properties plots on each page showing the time series of the four calculated properties for one animal.

### Settings
**Reference time (`time_now`):** reference timestamp towards which all analyses are performed. Generally (and by default) this is NOW, especially if in the field and looking for one or the other animal or wanting to make sure that it is still doing fine. When analysing older data sets, this parameter can be set to other timestamps so that the to be plotted data fall into a selected back-time window. 

**Track time duration. (`time_dur`):** time duration into the past that the attributes have to be plotted for. So, if the time duration is selected as 7 days then the x-axis ranges from the reference timestamp to 7 days before it. Unit: days

**Reference longitude (`posi_lon`):** longitude of the position to which average daily distances are to be calculated. Typically this is the observer position in the field, if one wants to find out if any tagged animals are in the surroundings.

**Reference latitude (`posi_lat`):** latitude of the position to which average daily distances are to be calculated. Typically this is the observer position in the field, if one wants to find out if any tagged animals are in the surroundings.

### Null or error handling:
**Setting `time_now`:** If this parameter is left empty (NULL) the reference time is set to NOW. The present timestamp is extracted in UTC from the MoveApps server system.

**Setting `time_dur`:** If this parameter is left empty (NULL) then by default 10 days is used. A respective warning is given.

**Setting `posi_lon`:** If this parameter is left emtpy (NULL), for each animal the longitude of the first available position is used as reference for the caclualtion of average daily distances to a position. This might be the catching site.

**Setting `posi_lat`:** If this parameter is left emtpy (NULL), for each animal the latitude of the first available position is used as reference for the caclualtion of average daily distances to a position. This might be the catching site.

**Data:** The data are not manipulated in this App, but properties of them plotted in a downloadable pdf. So that a possible Workflow can be continued after this App, the input data set is returned.
